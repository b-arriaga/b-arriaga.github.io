    longDescription: "Bitsy Rats was an exercise in building a miniatures brand with maximum personality. The Bitsy Rat character, buyer community, and unboxing moment create attachment and collectability. Numerous prototype rounds helped develop recognizable forms, standardized scale, and cohesive visuals. Packaging concepts were developed alongside the product to create an intentional reveal moment. The result is character-led collectibles that can scale through new themes, sizes, materials and formats. In recent developments, a puppet version of the Bitsy Rat serves as the face of the Bitsy Friends Studio brand and helps deliver more of the content pillars of the brand such as creative confidence, maker education, and studio safety.",

    longDescription: "At Urban TXT, the mission was to democratize the tools of invention. This meant transforming a former bookstore into a learning lab that local teens would feel confident enough to utilize. Tool selection, space design, and programming in the space were approached from a user-first perspective and by balancing operations and culture, we created safety and structure while still nurturing creativity and experimentation. In the first summer after the space opened, 60 high school teens entered the Summer Coding Leadership Academy and the students were able to use the makerspace to support their projects. The space's flexible design allowed for it to be used as a workshop space, a classroom, drop-in tech support, and meeting space for the student teams to work out their solutions together.",

    longDescription: "These prototypes study what makes a product feel alive and playful through physical motion and interactive features. Petal Planet investigated how a simple movement like a wobble could delight users and create moments of pause or reflection. The dog toy explores how patterned interactions with light cues and rewards could create a feedback loop to keep dogs interested in the toy for longer. Both concepts were approached as systems where a cue would prompt the user to interact with the product on a repeatable basis. After the user experience was defined, form was developed through several rapid prototyping techniques like laser cutting, 3D printing, and hand sculpting. ",
    brief: "Developing two separate products one for the kidult market and another for dog owners. Both products involved several rounds of iterations with instructors, stakeholders, and community surveys.",
